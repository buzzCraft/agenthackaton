# Google Hackathon 2023 - Wheelchair Pathfinding Agent
This project is a proof of concept for an agent that can interact with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase. The agent uses pgRouting to find the shortest path between two points, optimized for wheelchair users.
# Features
- Connects to a PostgreSQL database on Supabase
- Uses pgRouting to calculate the shortest path between two points
- Optimized for wheelchair users
- Using LangChain and Langgraph for agent and graph management
- Uses Google's Gemini API for natural language processing
